<h1>Testing and Inspection</h1>

<p>LJB Contractors are experts at electrical testing in both domestic and commercial property - to ensure that the fixed wiring is in good working and safe order. With the introduction of <a href="http://electrical.theiet.org/building-regulations/part-p/index.cfm" >Part P</a> in 2005 and the <a href="http://electrical.theiet.org/wiring-regulations/index.cfm" >17th edition<a> in 2008 there are many new rules and regulations to abide by to increase the safety of electricity in the home and workplace. An up to date electrical installation certificate will, naturally, offer you peace of mind.
